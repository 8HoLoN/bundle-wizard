# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è sourcemap-wizard

This small command line utility is built on top of [source-map-explorer](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer) to help you more easily create visualizations of which JS bundles were fetched for any specific entry point of an app.

The wizard simply:

1. Extracts relevant js bundle names from your [provided coverage json file](#more-info).
2. Fetches those js bundles along with their sourcemaps.
3. Feeds that information into [source-map-explorer](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer) for you, which will generate a colorful treemap visualization.

## Example

Here's a visualization generated by source-map-explorer of the js bundles fetched by Pinterest on the mobile home screen, with the color red indicating the code that was mostly unused during the bootup of the app:

## Installation

### For global access:

`npx sourcemap-wizard`

### Or in a project:

`npm install sourcemap-wizard`

## More info

Before you get started, you'll need to use the Chrome browser to [generate the coverage report](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/coverage) for the entry point you wish to analyze.

Next, run `npx source-map-wizard` and the wizard will walk you through the process of linking to the proper js bundles and sourcemaps to create the visualization. If you don't have them locally, it will conveniently download them for you.

**Note:** Downloading sourcemaps requires them to be publically available, or at least available on your network. You might need to point to a testing instead of prod build, for instance, as some apps disable sourcemaps in production.

## Optional command line arguments

You can optionally provide one of the following arguments to skip ahead in the wizard:

`--coverage=[path to file]`

If you don't need to download bundles and sourcemaps, you can also provide the `--bundles` argument:

`--bundles=[path to folder of js files and sourcemaps]`

### Here's what a run through the wizard might look like:
